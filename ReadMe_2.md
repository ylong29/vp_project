# How to use the Virtual Production sample with Unreal projects.

I've created video guides on how to quickly combine your own unreal projects with my virtual production sample.  Please see [Use your own sets tutorial](https://youtu.be/trlpmm5gI6U) on my YouTube channel.

# Important reminders

Before you try and use your own Unreal maps and assets, please get my sample running on your hardware first.  You want to have a running example to make sure verything works before you start adding your own stuff!

Also, once you have this running example, remember to make a BACKUP COPY of it in case you make a mistake moving over your own assets.  The easiest way to do this is to use the "clone" function in the unreal launcher to make a copy under another project name.

# PLEASE report any problems.

If you run into any problems using your own assets, please report them as an issue here on github or on [my youtube channel](https://www.youtube.com/user/GregCorson) and I'll try to help.
